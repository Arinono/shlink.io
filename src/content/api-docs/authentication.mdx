All endpoints require authentication. In order to do it, always provide a `X-Api-Key: {api_key}` header on every request.

API keys are generated (and managed) from the command line. Run the `api-key:generate` command to get a new and valid API key.

### Errors during authentication

When performing an API call, if no API key is provided or it is invalid/disabled/expired, the server will return this response payload, with status 401.

```json
{
  "type": "INVALID_API_KEY",
  "detail": "Provided API key does not exist or is invalid",
  "title": "Invalid API key",
  "status": 401
}
```
