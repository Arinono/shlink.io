Shlink provides a REST API that can be used to integrate the short URLs management on any system or application.

All the requests return JSON-encoded responses and semantic status codes, so it should be easy to implement client apps that consume this API.

However, if an unexpected error occurs, the system could end returning HTML. To prevent this, always pass the `Accept` header with the `application/json` value.

This API supports [CORS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-origin_resource_sharing) (aka cross domain), automatically generating required `Access-Control-*` headers and managing pre-flight (`OPTIONS`) requests, so it can be consumed from web clients hosted on different domains.

Follow the documentation in order to see how to manage errors and perform requests correctly.
