## REST API

Shlink provides a REST API that can be used to integrate the short URLs management on any consuming system or application.

### Content negotiation

All the requests return JSON-encoded responses by default, together with semantic status codes, so it should be easy to implement client apps that consume this API.

However, if an unexpected error occurs, the system could end up returning HTML. To prevent this, always pass the header `Accept: application/json`.

### CORS

This API supports [**C**ross-**O**rigin **R**esource **S**haring](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-origin_resource_sharing) (aka cross domain) out of the box.

It will automatically generate the required `Access-Control-*` headers and manage pre-flight (`OPTIONS`) requests, so it can be transparently consumed from web clients hosted on different domains.

### Expected formats

The API tries to be consistent on expected and returned formats, but these are some basic guidelines:

* All error response follow the [Problem Details](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7807) standard. You can find further information in [Error management](/documentation/api-docs/error-management).
* All returned dates will have the [ISO-8601](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601) format with offset from UTC (for example, `2020-01-23T05:16:00+02:00`).
* Any endpoint accepting dates will also expect the same format, usually resulting in `400 Bad Request` response when this is not fulfilled.
