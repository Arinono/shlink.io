## Tracking visits

One of the most interesting features in Shlink is the visits tracking.

Shlink will track every time your short URLs are opened, and then try to geolocate the visitor.

### Considerations

In order to geolocate visits, Shlink makes use of a [GeoLite2](https://dev.maxmind.com/geoip/geoip2/geolite2/) database, by [MaxMind](https://www.maxmind.com).

Depending on your setup, visits could be geolocated almost in real time (if you [serve Shlink with swoole](/documentation/serve-with-swoole) or use the [docker image](/documentation/install-docker-image)), or you will have to configure a [scheduled task](/documentation/long-running-tasks#locate-visits) that does it.

To make sure your GeoLite2 db is always up to date, you will have to [configure your own license key](/documentation/geolite-license-key).

Also, Shlink will make sure you fulfil most data protection regulations, by storing only an anonymized version of the visitor's IP address.

### Orphan visits

Starting with v2.6.0, Shlink can also track visits to any URL that would usually result in a "404 - Not found" error, also known as **orphan visits**.

These visits can have one of these types:

* `base_url`: Someone opened the base URL in which Shlink is hosted.
* `invalid_short_url`: Someone opened a short-url-like URL, but it did not resolve an existing short URL, or it was disabled.
* `regular_404`: Someone opened a route which Shlink didn't understand.

The visits will be tracked both if you configure special redirects from those three cases, but also if you leave Shlink serve a regular 404 status with a "Not found" template.

In case you don't need this, you can opt out from orphan visits tracking via configuration.
