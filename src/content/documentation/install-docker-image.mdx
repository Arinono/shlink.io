## Install using a docker image

The docker image is probably the simplest installation use case, since it includes all dependencies and makes use of swoole to serve Shlink.

If you plan to deploy shlink in a container-based infrastructure, you can just use the official [docker image](https://github.com/shlinkio/shlink/blob/master/docker/README.md).

Once deployed, you will need to run `docker exec -it shlink_container shlink api-key:generate` in order to generate the first API key.

Finally access to [shlink-web-client](https://app.shlink.io) and configure your server to start creating short URLs.

> If you want, you can also host shlink-web-client yourself as a [docker container](https://hub.docker.com/r/shlinkio/shlink-web-client/).
