## GeoLite2 license key

Shlink makes use of a [GeoLite2](https://dev.maxmind.com/geoip/geoip2/geolite2/) database, by [MaxMind](https://www.maxmind.com), to geolocate visits to your short URLs.

In order to ensure the data is up-to-date, it downloads new versions of the database regularly.

However, in order to do this, Shlink needs a GeoLite2 license key. These licenses are free, and Shlink includes a default one since v1.21.1, when the license conditions changed.

The problem of using the default license key is that there are daily download limits, and if many users are sharing this, it's very likely to reach those limits.

Because of that, since v2.1.4, it is possible, and **strongly recommended**, to provide your own GeoLite2 license key to Shlink.

<Callout type="warning">
    Shlink 3.0, when released, will no longer provide a default license key, and you will have to provide your own.
</Callout>

### Generate a license key

In order to generate the license key, follow these steps.

* Create a MaxMind [account for GeoLite2](https://www.maxmind.com/en/geolite2/signup).
* Generate a [license key](https://www.maxmind.com/en/accounts/current/license-key). Its **important** that you save the value, as you will not be able to recover it afterwards.

### Provide the license key to Shlink

Once you have your license key, you will need to provide it to Shlink.

* If you are using the docker image, use the `GEOLITE_LICENSE_KEY` env var.
* In other cases, you will be asked to provide the license key when installing or updating Shlink.
