## Real-time updates

Once your Shlink instance is set-up, you may want to enable real-time updates to be sent to third parties when certain events occur.

Currently, Shlink supports two ways to do that.

* Configuring some [webhooks](#webhooks) that will be notified with new visits.
* Integrating with a [mercure hub server](#mercure-hub-server) to be able to subscribe to server-sent events.

> **Important!** You need to know that real-time updates only work when [serving Shlink with swoole](/documentation/serve-with-swoole), which is the case if you are using the [docker image](/documentation/install-docker-image).

### Webhooks

If you run Shlink's install CLI tool (`bin/install`) you probably noticed there's one step in which you are asked to provide a "comma-separated list of webhook URLs".

Similarly, if you checked the available [env vars](/documentation/install-docker-image#supported-env-vars) for the docker image, there's one called `VISITS_WEBHOOKS`, which also expects a comma-separated list of URLs.

Those two mechanisms can be used to configure a list of endpoints which will receive a `POST` request from Shlink when a short URL is visited.

The body of the request will contain the payload of both the `shortUrl` that was visited, and the `visit` with the geolocation, like this:

```json
{
  "shortUrl": {
    "shortCode": "12C18",
    "shortUrl": "https://doma.in/12C18",
    "longUrl": "https://store.steampowered.com",
    "dateCreated": "2016-08-21T20:34:16+02:00",
    "visitsCount": 328,
    "tags": [
      "games",
      "tech"
    ],
    "meta": {
      "validSince": "2017-01-21T00:00:00+02:00",
      "validUntil": null,
      "maxVisits": 100
    },
    "domain": null
  },
  "visit": {
    "referer": "https://t.co",
    "date": "2015-08-20T05:05:03+04:00",
    "userAgent": "Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/51.0.2704.103 Safari/537.36",
    "visitLocation": {
      "cityName": "Cupertino",
      "countryCode": "US",
      "countryName": "United States",
      "latitude": 37.3042,
      "longitude": -122.0946,
      "regionName": "California",
      "timezone": "America/Los_Angeles"
    }
  }
}
```

> Webhooks were included on Shlink **v1.21.0**, so it's not possible to use them with previous versions.

### Mercure hub server

A more advanced way to get real-time updates is by taking advantage of the integration with a [mercure](https://mercure.rocks) hub server.

Mercure provides server-sent events, so that consumers can subscribe to some of those events and get automatically notified when Shlink publishes them.

#### Configure the mercure hub server

The mercure hub server will act as an intermediary between Shlink, which will be publishing updates on it, and consumers, which will subscribe to those updates and get notified by the hub.

The first thing you need to do is [install the mercure hub](https://mercure.rocks/docs/hub/install) server. There's both a prebuilt dependency-less binary, and a docker image too, which is the best option to use together with Shlink's docker image.

> The mercure hub server accepts several config options. It is important to provide at least these:
>
> * `--cors-allowed-origins`|`CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS`: if you want to consume updates from a browser web app (like shlink-web-client), this option should have the value `"*"` or the domain from which you plan to consume mercure, otherwise, it will reject the connection.
> * `--jwt-key`|`JWT_KEY`: The same value provided to Shlink should be used here, otherwise, the JWTs generated by Shlink will be rejected by mercure and neither publishing nor subscribing will be possible.

#### Interaction between the parts

Once installed, this is the representation of how Shlink, the mercure hub and consumers will interact:

![Shlink and mercure hub interaction](/images/mercure/mercure-architecture.png)

* Shlink knows Mercure hub's public URL and the JWT secret key.
* Shlink can generate JWTs for mercure, which only have permission for subscribing.
* Shlink publishes updates to mercure when something needs to be notified to consumers.
* Consumers get valid JWTs and the hub URL from Shlink's REST API, by calling `GET /rest/v2/mercure-info`.
* Consumers subscribe to topics on the mercure hub using the JWT returned on previous request.
* If the JWT expires, consumers can call the endpoint as many times as they need to get new JWTs.

This flow ensures the JWT key is never leaked by accident, and you need to have a valid Shlink API key in order to get valid JWTs for mercure.

Also, JWTs returned to consumers will only have permission to subscribe to updates. Only Shlink will be able to publish updates.

> If you use shlink-web-client to interact with your Shlink instance, it will work out of the box and consume updates from mercure, updating the UI in real-time where applicable.

#### Topics and payloads

This is the list of topics to which consumers can subscribe to, together with their payloads:

* *Any short URL receives a new visit.*

    Topic: `https://shlink.io/new-visit`,

    Payload:

    ```json
    {
      "shortUrl": {
        "shortCode": "12C18",
        "shortUrl": "https://doma.in/12C18",
        "longUrl": "https://store.steampowered.com",
        "dateCreated": "2016-08-21T20:34:16+02:00",
        "visitsCount": 328,
        "tags": [
          "games",
          "tech"
        ],
        "meta": {
          "validSince": "2017-01-21T00:00:00+02:00",
          "validUntil": null,
          "maxVisits": 100
        },
        "domain": null
      },
      "visit": {
        "referer": "https://t.co",
        "date": "2015-08-20T05:05:03+04:00",
        "userAgent": "Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/51.0.2704.103 Safari/537.36",
        "visitLocation": {
          "cityName": "Cupertino",
          "countryCode": "US",
          "countryName": "United States",
          "latitude": 37.3042,
          "longitude": -122.0946,
          "regionName": "California",
          "timezone": "America/Los_Angeles"
        }
      }
    }
    ```

* *A specific short URL receives a new visit.*

    Topic: `https://shlink.io/new-visit/{shortCode}`,

    Payload:

    ```json
    {
      "shortUrl": {
        "shortCode": "12C18",
        "shortUrl": "https://doma.in/12C18",
        "longUrl": "https://store.steampowered.com",
        "dateCreated": "2016-08-21T20:34:16+02:00",
        "visitsCount": 328,
        "tags": [
          "games",
          "tech"
        ],
        "meta": {
          "validSince": "2017-01-21T00:00:00+02:00",
          "validUntil": null,
          "maxVisits": 100
        },
        "domain": null
      },
      "visit": {
        "referer": "https://t.co",
        "date": "2015-08-20T05:05:03+04:00",
        "userAgent": "Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/51.0.2704.103 Safari/537.36",
        "visitLocation": {
          "cityName": "Cupertino",
          "countryCode": "US",
          "countryName": "United States",
          "latitude": 37.3042,
          "longitude": -122.0946,
          "regionName": "California",
          "timezone": "America/Los_Angeles"
        }
      }
    }
    ```

    > Remember that the `shortCode` does not uniquely identify a short URL, as the same one could be used for several domains. You should always introspect the `shortUrl.domain` property in order to verify it is the one you want.

> The integration with mercure is available since Shlink **v2.2.0** and shlink-web-client **v2.5.0**.
