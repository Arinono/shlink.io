## Serve Shlink using swoole or openswoole

Shlink can be served using [swoole or openswoole](https://www.swoole.co.uk/).

Swoole provides a non-blocking I/O server similar to the one used for node.js applications, which lets web apps to be run once and kept in memory while serving requests.

It is recommended to serve Shlink with swoole or openswoole, since it is quite faster and has a few extra benefits (like running some heavy tasks immediately after a request has been served).

<Callout type="info">
  Starting with v2.10.0, Shlink supports both swoole and openswoole extensions, as their APIs do not deviate too much.
  However, it's very likely that support for regular swoole is dropped in next major release, so it's recommended to use <b>openswoole</b> instead.
</Callout>

In order to use swoole or openswoole, you have to install the swoole PHP extension using Pecl: `pecl install openswoole-4.8.1`.

You will also need to create a daemon script, in `/etc/init.d/shlink_swoole`.

You can use this sample, replacing `/path/to/shlink` by the path to your shlink installation:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
### BEGIN INIT INFO
# Provides:          shlink_swoole
# Required-Start:    $local_fs $network $named $time $syslog
# Required-Stop:     $local_fs $network $named $time $syslog
# Default-Start:     2 3 4 5
# Default-Stop:      0 1 6
# Description:       Shlink non-blocking server with openswoole
### END INIT INFO

SCRIPT=/path/to/shlink/vendor/bin/laminas\ mezzio:swoole:start
RUNAS=root

PIDFILE=/var/run/shlink_swoole.pid
LOGDIR=/var/log/shlink
LOGFILE=${LOGDIR}/shlink_swoole.log

start() {
  if [[ -f "$PIDFILE" ]] && kill -0 $(cat "$PIDFILE"); then
    echo 'Shlink with openswoole already running' >&2
    return 1
  fi
  echo 'Starting shlink with openswoole' >&2
  mkdir -p "$LOGDIR"
  touch "$LOGFILE"
  local CMD="$SCRIPT &> \"$LOGFILE\" & echo \$!"
  su -c "$CMD" $RUNAS > "$PIDFILE"
  echo 'Shlink started' >&2
}

stop() {
  if [[ ! -f "$PIDFILE" ]] || ! kill -0 $(cat "$PIDFILE"); then
    echo 'Shlink with openswoole not running' >&2
    return 1
  fi
  echo 'Stopping shlink with openswoole' >&2
  kill -15 $(cat "$PIDFILE") && rm -f "$PIDFILE"
  echo 'Shlink stopped' >&2
}

case "$1" in
  start)
    start
    ;;
  stop)
    stop
    ;;
  restart)
    stop
    start
    ;;
  *)
    echo "Usage: $0 {start|stop|restart}"
esac
```

<Callout type="warning">
  Notice that prior to v2.5, the SCRIPT was <code className="no-highlight">vendor/bin/mezzio-swoole start</code>. This will continue working but is considered deprecated and will be removed in Shlink v3.0.0. Replace it with <code className="no-highlight">vendor/bin/laminas mezzio:swoole:start</code> as soon as possible (see the example above).
</Callout>

Then run these commands to enable the service and start it:

* `sudo chmod +x /etc/init.d/shlink_swoole`
* `sudo update-rc.d shlink_swoole defaults`
* `sudo update-rc.d shlink_swoole enable`
* `/etc/init.d/shlink_swoole start`

After that, you should be able to access shlink on port 8080. The service will be automatically run at system start-up, and all access logs will be written in `/var/log/shlink/shlink_swoole.log`.

### Exposing Shlink through a reverse proxy

Event though previous steps are enough to make Shlink usable, there are still a couple of missing things to make it production-ready.

Follow [the instructions](/documentation/advanced/exposing-through-reverse-proxy) to configure a reverse proxy in front of Shlink.
