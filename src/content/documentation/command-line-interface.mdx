## Command Line Interface

Shlink provides a CLI tool which exposes a set of commands to perform a variety of operations.

From creating, updating or listing short URLs, to manage API keys or handle the list of tags.

### Commands

Commands in shlink are contextually namespaced in `api-key`, `db`, `short-url`, `tag` and `visit`.

By running the `bin/cli` script you will see the full list of commands with a description for each one of them.

Running any command with the `-h` flag will display an extended help for that specific command, showing the list of arguments and a descriptive explanation on how to use it.

This is the full list of commands exposed by Shlink's CLI tool:
