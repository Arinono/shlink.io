## Getting started

Shlink is a URL shortener which provides both [REST](/documentation/api-docs) and [CLI](/documentation/command-line-interface) interfaces to interact with it.

There are a couple of ways to install and run it, depending on your needs and resources.

You can run Shlink in a container-based infrastructure, using the [docker image](/documentation/install-docker-image), but you can also [download a dist file](/documentation/install-dist-file) to host it in your machine and serve it with:

* [A non-blocking swoole server](/documentation/serve-with-swoole).
* [A classic web server](/documentation/classic-web-server) (like Apache or Nginx).
